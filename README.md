# HuffmanCompressor_Full

## 📘 Project Overview

**HuffmanCompressor_Full** is a GUI-based C++ application that demonstrates both standard character-level Huffman compression and an optimized word-level Huffman compression technique. Developed using the Qt framework, it allows users to:

- Compress text files
- Visualize bitstring output
- Perform decompression
- Compare memory usage between the two methods

The project serves as a practical implementation of greedy algorithms and is suitable for educational demonstrations and research purposes.

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- **Frontend / GUI**: Qt Widgets (C++ with `.ui` files)
- **Backend Logic**: C++ (Huffman Tree, file handling, compression algorithms)

### 🧠 Compression Techniques
- Standard Huffman (character-based)
- Modified Huffman (word-based)

### 🛠️ Tools
- Qt Creator IDE
- MinGW 64-bit Compiler

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Qt Creator installed (tested with Qt 6.9.0)
- MinGW or compatible C++ compiler

### 📦 Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/chandnimaithil207/HuffmanCompressor_Full.git
cd HuffmanCompressor_Full
```

1. Open `HuffmanCompressor.pro` in Qt Creator  
2. Configure the build environment (MinGW recommended)  
3. Build and run the application

## ✅ Features

- Standard Huffman coding using character frequency
- Modified Huffman coding using word frequency
- File compression with bitstring output
- Decompression for both character and word Huffman data
- Memory usage comparison (in KB and percentage)
- GUI-based interaction for file selection and operation
- Clear display of input, compressed output, and stats

---

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- Verified correct bitstring generation for both methods
- Ensured successful decompression matches original content
- Memory saved calculated using original vs compressed file size
- GUI interactions tested for both typical and edge-case inputs
- Compared results across different types of text data (plain, repeated, mixed)

## 📊 Sample Results

| Input File | Original Size | Char Huffman | Word Huffman | Memory Saved        |
|------------|----------------|---------------|----------------|----------------------|
| sample.txt | 10 KB         | 5.2 KB        | 3.3 KB         | Char: 48%, Word: 67% |

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Batch compression of multiple files
